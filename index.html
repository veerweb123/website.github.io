                             <br>Researchers demonstrate customized implants that
                             help injured nerves regenerate in rats.Bridging

                             latest. Additive manufacturing, or 3-D printing, 
                             makes it possible to build more customized bio-
                             medical implants, and has become a popular way
                             to make dental implants and even windpipes.
